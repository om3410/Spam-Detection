# Spam-Detection
🚀 Just Completed: Spam Detection System 🚀

Excited to share my latest project - a comprehensive Spam Detection System built for my Machine Learning Internship with Syntexhub!

🔧 What I Built:

A complete ML-powered system to detect spam messages

Real-time classification with probability scores

Interactive analytics dashboard

Dual-mode operation (ML Model + Demo keyword detection)

⚙️ Tech Stack:

Backend: Python, Scikit-learn, Naive Bayes Algorithm

NLP: TF-IDF Vectorization for text processing

Frontend: Streamlit for interactive web interface

Features: Real-time predictions, analytics, history tracking

🌟 Key Features:
✅ Instant message classification (Spam/Ham)
✅ Probability scores with confidence metrics
✅ Interactive visualizations
✅ Prediction history tracking
✅ Demo mode with keyword detection

This project taught me practical implementation of NLP techniques, model deployment, and creating user-friendly ML applications.

Check out the code and try it yourself! Would love to hear your thoughts 👇
